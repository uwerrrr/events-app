# Events app

- A full-stack event management via calendar view.

### Current status:

- Finish <u>stage 1</u>: a frontend with interactive calendar interface is developed.
- In <u>stage 2</u>: developing a feature to allow user to create and delete event from calendar view.

### Deployed version
- You can access the project by following this [link](https://oscar-event-site.onrender.com).
- The frontend, backend and database are deployed using render.com.
- Please access the deployed version with Chromium-based browsers like Chrome for best experience.
- !! Important: The backend is deployed with a free tier, so the initial load may take up to 2 minutes if it's waking up from sleep mode.
